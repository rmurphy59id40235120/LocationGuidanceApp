Blind and Partially Sighted (BPS) users struggle to enter text when using their mobile phones.  
Speech input would be much more convenient.  Modern speech recognition software can provide 
good quality speech recognition. For output, synthesised speech is also ideal for BPS users.  
Together, these technologies could enable a conversation-based user interface for BPS users.  
However, for computational reasons, the software for managing the conversation needs to run on 
a cloud-based server. 
 
The goal of this project will be to develop an app which demonstrates a speech-based user 
interface for BPS users.  The app itself will communicate with a cloud-based server, sending the 
speech to be recognised, and receiving an synthesised mp3 file to play in response.
