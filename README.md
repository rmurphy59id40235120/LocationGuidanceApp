When touring venues such as open-air museums or public gardens, it is useful to have an audio 
commentary on the various points of interest, plus navigation instructions to get to the next point 
of interest.  An app on a mobile phone is a convenient way to provide this.   
 
The goal of this project is therefore to develop an app which demonstrates user tracking and 
guidance on a mobile phone.  Such an app requires the ability to find the user’s location, and to 
match this to points on a map of the venue.  It also requires the ability to give navigation 
instructions to the user, and to play the commentary for a point of interest when the user arrives 
there.  The project will involve exploring the options for third party location tracking.  Ideally, the 
device’s location coordinates will be sent to a remote server, which will know the required 
destination, and send navigation instructions back to the app.  Software running on the remote 
server should be written in Python.  Guidance instructions can be given by playing pre-synthesised 
mp3 files on the device.  For this project, no particular user input will be required (except perhaps 
tapping the screen for answering Yes/No type questions).
